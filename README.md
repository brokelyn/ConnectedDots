# Connected Dots

## What is this?

This is a small simulation of dots which are connected by springs. These springs
hold the dots together though they can only be expanded to a maximum size before breaking.

## Game Engine

Because game engines provide an easy and powerful way of 2D and 3D gaphics the open source
and lightweight game engine **GODOT** is used.
